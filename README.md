# ðŸŽµ Syphia Open Source Discord Bot

## What is Syphia Beta? ðŸ¤”

The beta version marks the initial creation of the bot, and although I am ending its development, most of its functions work, albeit with some error messages and issues in the emoji system. Instead of fixing it, I have decided to transition to a new project to enhance the infrastructure. Even in its current state, it employs advanced technologies surpassing many other music bots. You can explore the infrastructure and use parts that might be useful for your own projects. However, I recommend waiting for the full release, Syphia V1.

## What to Expect from Syphia V1? ðŸš€

Development for Syphia V1 began on June 3rd. However, given our numerous orders in **For Development**, our software company, this open-source project takes a backseat. It will continue as a side project developed during our free time, but I am confident the final version will exceed your expectations.

## What Happens When Syphia V1 is Released? ðŸ“…

Upon release, Syphia V1 will be launched on the Discord platform by the **For Development** Team and the first version will be officially verified. Our team includes **Minik Militan**, **Cartel**, **Pusha**, **Papaz**, **Ancient**, **Jessia**, and **Wyntine**, whom many of you already know. We dominate the software scene in the Discord media. Syphia is a **For Development** project and belongs to **For Development**. You can contribute to the repository, contact us, or develop the beta version if you want to benefit from this project. The V1 version will also be open to everyone.

## Syphia's Compelling Features ðŸ’¡

- **Live Config**: All string, console, and settings systems are based on YAML files and are used within the bot through custom definitions. Thanks to the advanced config system, most settings and messages can be adjusted without shutting down the bot.
- **Shard System**: The shard system can be modified both automatically and manually and is managed by a robust automation.
- **Optimized Command and Event System**: The primary system, comprising commands and events, is an optimized, fast handler group. It is written closer to OOP programming languages, resulting in faster and more efficient operation.
- **Music Commands**: Currently, Syphia has 19 music commands, aiming to optimize them further:
  - Autoplay
  - Filter
  - Forward
  - Join
  - Leave
  - Loop
  - Pause
  - Play
  - Playnow
  - Queue
  - Remove
  - Resume
  - Rewind
  - Seek
  - Shuffle
  - Skip
  - SkipTo
  - Stop
  - Volume
- **Event Handling**: The event reading system is divided into two parts and supported by two different creator classes, providing high optimization and order within the bot. These events are triggered as needed within a single handler.
- **Automated Database Operations**: All data is recorded for user settings through automation.
- **Custom Type Definitions**: The system features unique type definitions and files, setting it apart from other similar systems. It doesn't resemble the typical TypeScript and JavaScript infrastructures, instead aligning more closely with Java language and principles.

For now, that's all. All the information provided here pertains to the beta version. The V1 version will be far more advanced and will undoubtedly satisfy your expectations.
